# Landing Page Project

- First i have added the navigation bar links dynamiclly

- I created a function to create a link for each section and calling it after that.

- i created an active link and section that are connected with each other in the UI that the section reflect the link in the navigation bar 

- creating a new calss called "active__link" to style the links during the scrolling

- creating an event to make the page go smoothly while clicking the section link on the navigation bar
